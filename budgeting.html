    <h1> Budgeting Tips!
            1. Record all your expenses. Keeping yourself organized will help you find new ways to save and keep track on how much to spend. 
            2. Build up your Savings: be prepared for unexpected expenses by setting aside money. Set a certain amount of each month. 
            3. Start paying off your student loan: Even if its in small amounts, its important to get into the habit of making regular payments. 
            4. Determine how much you can spend for expenses such as dining and social events. 
            5. Invest. Using whatever money you have left at the end of the month to invest in stocks or bonds or place in savings can really help. 
            6. Find ways to save: use coupons, your student ID for discounts, and don't overbuy at the grocery store.
